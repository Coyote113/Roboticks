To edit data in the path file, you can use thonny ide (https://thonny.org/)

    connect your device to the pico w board in the robot and open thonny

    in the bottom right of the screen click 'Local Python 3'

    there should be an option to connect to the pico w microcontroller, click on that to connect

    open the '_path.txt' file

    add your gps points here, note that line 1 is the first point, line 2 is the second point, etc


To start the robot flip the power switch at the back

    the red light will flash for 10-100 seconds (maybe more) as the gps gets setup

    when the green light turns on you can press the green button to start the pathfinding algorithm

    once it starts you can click either button to stop it


to add points to the path.txt file without opening up the robot

    when the green light turns on after the gps is setup press the blue button

    after that first press everytime you press the blue button it will save your current gps location to its RAM

    if you press the green button it will flush the points stored in the RAM to the path file

    note that this will write over the points already in the path file
