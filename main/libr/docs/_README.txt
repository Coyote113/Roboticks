this docs folder is used as documentation for the different methods / classes used to complete actions
in the main file.

DO NOT REMOVE the files from the libr folder as the methods / classes are used in the main_f folder but feel
free to use a copy of them in you own files, and this folder is to explain what each file does and why.
