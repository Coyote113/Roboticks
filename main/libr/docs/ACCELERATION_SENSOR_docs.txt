ACCELERATION_SENSOR documentation

Cole Johnson 11/21/23

this is documentation for the ACCELERATION_SENSOR method and should be used to read ADC values from an acceleration
sensor, specifically a ADXL335.


    Constructor and init function

the accel object can be created by calling

from ACCELERATION_SENSOR.py import create_ACCELERATION_SENSOR
accel = create_ACCELERATION_SENSOR(x_pin, y_pin, z_pin)

the parameters for the init function are the x, y, and z ADC input pins running from the acceleration sensor
to the board. Remember that they must be using ADC pins.
accel is now you acceleration sensor object.


    method / class functions

the function get_tilt_tuple_pitch_roll() returns a 2 variable tuple in the format (current_pitch, current_roll).

example:
tuple = accel.get_tilt_tuple_pitch_roll()
pitch = tuple[0]
roll = tuple[1]

or

pitch = accel.get_tilt_tuple_pitch_roll()[0]
roll = accel.get_tilt_tuple_pitch_roll()[1]

the function get_accel_tuple_xyz() returns a 3 variable tuple in the format 
(acceleration_in_x_direction, acceleration_in_y_direction, acceleration_in_z_direction)

example:
tuple = accel.get_accel_tuple_xyz()
x_acceleration = tuple[0]
y_acceleration = tuple[1]
z_acceleration = tuple[2]


    Notes

there are other functions in the method, however they are used for calculating the acceleration or angle of the
acceleration sensor. those are read_acceleration(para), and calculate_tilt_angles(para). in most situations you
should only be calling the method / class functions stated above.


example:
from ACCELERATION_SENSOR.py import create_ACCELERATION_SENSOR
accel = create_ACCELERATION_SENSOR(28, 27, 26) # constructor init function

while True
    pitch = accel.get_tilt_tuple_pitch_roll()[0]
    roll = accel.get_tilt_tuple_pitch_roll()[1]
    x_acceleration = accel.get_accel_tuple_xyz()[0]
    y_acceleration = accel.get_accel_tuple_xyz()[1]
    z_acceleration = accel.get_accel_tuple_xyz()[2]
    # add a slight delay
