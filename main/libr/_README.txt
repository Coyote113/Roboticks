the libr file is used as an added library folder that I made in order to simplify the main code file and add
more modularity to the program. Many of them could be easily taken and used in another program.

DO NOT TOUCH THE __pycache__ FOLDER as its used for setting up the python files.

the docs folder will have a lot of information about the different py files in the libr folder.

DO NOT MESS WITH THE OTHER py FILES. its fine to take a copy of the file if you want to use that method
however deleting them from the libr file will cause issues in the main_f folder and the main code file which
relies on those methods to do calculations.

you can read more about what each py method does in the included docs file.

note that all methods here are called using import libr.method as they are all in the libr folder.
